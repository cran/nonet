# nonet

nonet is a unified solution for weighted average ensemble in supervised and unsupervised learning environment. It is a novel approach to provide weighted average ensembled predictions without using labels from outcome or response variable for weight computation. In a nutshell, nonet can be used in two scenarios: 

- This approach can be used in the unsupervised environment where outcome labels not available.
- This  approach can be used to impute the missing values in the real-time scenarios in supervised and unsupervised environment because nonet does not require training labels to compute the weights for ensemble. 

## Getting Started:
one of the best way to start with this project is, have a look at [vignettes](https://github.com/GSLabDev/nonet/tree/master/vignettes).
Vignettes provides clear idea about how nonet can contribute to ensemble different models all together.

nonet also available on [Github Page](https://open.gslab.com/nonet/)
